1. If the operators are +-/*, then yes, they can be. 
2. Syntax refers to the grammar of a programming language. Therefore, a 
   syntax  error refers to failure in conforming to the grammar of a
   particular language, which would result in a compiler being unable to
   compile the program. On the other hand, a logic error is when a 
   program does not understand what it is expected to do. 
3. True
4. Yes it is- 10 is greater than 0, and 15 is greater than 10 
5. The "then" is unnecessary. A semicolon is missing, and the condition 
   needs to be in brackets
