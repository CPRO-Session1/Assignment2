Olivier Gabison - Answers to Part 2 Questions

1. Yes, for example you can have:
int x = (10 * 20)/2 //This has two operators. You can keep adding operators, there is no "maximum" amount
of numbers you can't have.

2. An example of a logical error would be misspelling words such as 'int' as 'itn'. Another
example would be forgetting to place a semicolon at the end of a statement.

3. Outcome of: x >= 10 && x < 25 && x != 12 if x=10;
True && True && True. All are true, thus the outcome is true;
