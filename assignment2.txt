Olivier Gabison - Answers to Part 2 Questions

1. Yes, for example you can have:
int x = (10 * 20)/2 //This has two operators. You can keep adding operators, there is no "maximum" amount
of numbers you can't have.

2. An example of a logical error would be misspelling words such as 'int' as 'itn'. Another
example would be forgetting to place a semicolon at the end of a statement.

3. Outcome of: x >= 10 && x < 25 && x != 12 if x=10;
True && True && True. All are true, thus the outcome is true;

4. No, it is not correct. This is because you cannot use this as a condition. Instead,
you have to do: x > 0 && x < 15

5. The only valid one is 3.
1 is incorrect because you 'then' is not a reserved word in C. You have to use brackets
instead of then.
2 is incorrect because you need parenthesis around the conditional statement.
4 is incorrect because you need a semicolon after c = 0;
