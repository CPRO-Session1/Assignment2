1.  There can be two or more operators in a single line of program code as long as there is a logical operator seperating the relational operator statements. 

2. Syntax errors are incorrect spellings of reserved words or incorrect puncuation. Logical errors give an output that is unexpected or unwanted. 

3. 10>= && 10<25 && 10 !=12
     true    true     true
	  answer=true

4. The given example is incorrect because there cannot be more then one relational operator in a single statement. This is only allowed, however, when there is a logical operator inbetween them. The statement can instead look like this: 0<x && x<15. This represents what x has to be equal to under these circumstances. 

5. Example i is invalid because 'then' should not be written. Example ii is invalid because there needs to be parentheses around a>b. Example iii is valid. Example iv is invalid because there needs to be a semicolon(;) after c=0.
